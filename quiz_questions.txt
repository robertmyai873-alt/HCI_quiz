# HCI Course Important Concepts and Theories

## Week 1: Introduction to HCI and Course Logistics

**Key Definitions:**
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI): The study of interaction between humans and computers involving three components: Human, Computer, and Interaction
- Task: An activity that users want to accomplish (e.g., book a ticket online, register for a course, analyze data)
- Affordances: The relationship between properties of an object and capabilities of the agent that determine how the object could be used
- Signifiers: Any mark, sound, or perceivable indicator that communicates appropriate behavior to a person

**Important Theories:**
- Herbert Simon's Ant Theory: Complexity of behavior often lies in the environment rather than the individual
- HCI Definition Flow: Task → Human → Computer → Interaction → Output
- Three Components of HCI: Human (sensory, motor, cognitive system, emotion), Computer (input/output devices, processing), Interaction (interfaces)

**Key Principles:**
- Know your users - you are not your user
- Design for your users, not personal preferences
- Avoid unethical design practices (dark patterns)

## Week 2: User-Centered Design and Needfinding

**Key Definitions:**
- User-Centered Design (UCD): A design approach that considers actual users' needs throughout the entire design process
- Needfinding: The process of finding users' needs, desires, goals, preferences, and expectations
- Stakeholders: Anyone affected by success or failure of system (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary, Facilitating)
- Extreme Users: Users at the ends of the spectrum with more demanding or unique needs

**UCD Principles:**
1. Design based on explicit understanding of users, tasks, environments
2. Users involved throughout design and development
3. Design driven by user-centered evaluation
4. Process is iterative
5. Design addresses whole user experience
6. Design team includes multidisciplinary skills

**Needfinding Techniques:**
- Interviews: Structure with introduction, kick-off, build rapport, grand tour, reflection
- Surveys, User Observations, Focus Groups, Diary Studies, Ethnography

## Week 3: Design Alternatives and Ideation

**Key Definitions:**
- Brainstorming: An ideation technique for generating many possible solutions
- Personas: Characters representing users, allowing empathy with goals, needs, wants, and frustrations
- Storyboards: Series of sketches illustrating how users interact with product/UI
- Point of View (POV): A unique, concise reframing of the problem grounded in user needs
- How Might We (HMW): Short questions that launch brainstorms in a positive, actionable way

**Brainstorming Rules:**
- Generate quantity over quality initially
- First individually, then in groups
- No justification needed during generation
- Let everyone speak

**POV Framework:** [USER] needs to [USER'S NEED] because [SURPRISING INSIGHT]

## Week 4: Prototyping and Task Analysis

**Key Definitions:**
- Task Analysis: The process of learning about users by observing them in action

**Fidelity Levels:**
- Low-fidelity: Paper prototypes (cheap, quick iteration)
- Medium-fidelity: Clickable wireframes (interactive storyboards)
- High-fidelity: Realistic prototypes similar to actual product

## Week 5: Principles, Heuristics, and Feedback

**Key Definitions:**
- Feedback: Essential part of interactive systems that informs users what has happened
- Gulf of Execution: Difference between user intentions and what the system allows
- Gulf of Evaluation: Difficulty of assessing the system state
- Direct Manipulation: Interaction style where users act on displayed objects using physical, incremental, reversible actions

**Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics:**
1. Visibility of system status
2. Match between system and the real world
3. User control and freedom
4. Consistency and standards
5. Error prevention
6. Recognition rather than recall
7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
10. Help and documentation

**Shneiderman's 8 Golden Rules:**
1. Strive for consistency
2. Enable frequent users to use shortcuts
3. Offer informative feedback
4. Design dialogs to yield closure
5. Offer error prevention and simple error handling
6. Permit easy reversal of actions
7. Support internal locus of control
8. Reduce short-term memory load

## Week 6: Visual Design

**Key Definitions:**
- Visual Design: Aims to be practical and help designers increase usability
- Visual Hierarchy: Principle of arranging elements to show their order of importance
- Typography Elements: Font vs. typeface, weight, serif vs. sans serif vs. monospace
- Grid: Structure made of intersecting lines used to structure content

**Visual Hierarchy Elements:**
- Size: Larger elements noticed more easily
- Color: Bright colors attract more attention
- Contrast: Dramatically contrasted colors are eye-catching
- Alignment: Out-of-alignment elements stand out
- Repetition: Repeating styles suggest related content
- Proximity: Closely placed elements seem related
- Whitespace: More space draws the eye

**Color Theory:**
- Monochromatic: Shades and tints of same color
- Analogous: Similar colors that work well together
- Complementary: High contrast colors that enhance each other
- Triadic: Colors spaced equally on color wheel

## Week 7: User Research and Evaluation

**Key Definitions:**
- User Research: Getting information about users - their goals, behavior, and reaction to technology
- Evaluation: Checking your own work through systematic methods
- Heuristic Evaluation: Expert review using established usability principles
- Usability Testing: Systematic testing to uncover problems and learn about users
- A/B Testing: Comparing two versions while running live
- Web Analytics: Technology for collection, measurement, analysis of website usage data

**Fitts' Law:** T = k log2 (D/S + 1.0) - Model predicting user performance based on distance to target and target size

**Experimental Design Types:**
- Between-subject design: Different participants for each condition
- Within-subject design: Same participants across all conditions

## Week 8: Cognition in HCI

**Key Definitions:**
- Cognition: Mental action or process of acquiring knowledge through thought, experience, and senses
- Experiential Cognition: Intuitive, effortless, fast thinking (System 1)
- Reflective Cognition: Mental effort, attention, slow thinking (System 2)
- Attention: Selectively focusing on specific aspects of the interface

**Memory Types:**
- Sensory memory: Shortest, buffer

- Adaptive Interfaces: Systems that modify themselves based on user behavior

**Interface Intelligence Characteristics:**
- Can adapt to different user needs
- Can learn new concepts and techniques
- Can anticipate user needs
- Can take initiative and make suggestions
- Can provide explanations of actions

**Why IUIs are needed:**
- Interfaces are becoming too complex
- Current interfaces are too inflexible
- Interfaces don't adapt when user needs change
- Interfaces don't work well together

## Week 10: Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

**Key Definitions:**
- Human-Robot Interaction (HRI): Concerned with ways robots interact with people in the social world
- Robot Definition: Physical entity with body, sensors, actuators, controller, environment, and function
- Robotics Core Principle: "Robotics is the intelligent connection of perception to action"

**Important Theories:**
- Human-Robot Symbiotic Societies: Communities where humans and robots interact mutually beneficially
- The Uncanny Valley: Theory that almost human-looking robots create feelings of uncanniness
- Kendon's F-Formation Theory: Spatial formations in social interaction

**Design Principles:**
- Form Follows Function: Robot shape should relate to intended purpose
- Underpromise and Overdeliver: Avoid creating unrealistic expectations
- Matching Form and Function: Robot appearance should drive appropriate expectations
- Don't Mix Metaphors: Design should be holistic
- Interaction Expands Function: Design should be open-ended

**Types of Interaction:**

**Dark Pattern Types:**
- Nagging: Persistent redirection beyond multiple interactions
- Obstruction: Making processes unnecessarily difficult
- Interface Interference: UI manipulation privileging certain actions

**Ethical Design Principles:**
- Obtain proper informed consent
- Avoid manipulation
- Respect user autonomy

**Critical Considerations:**
- Technology should enhance human capabilities while maintaining ethical boundaries
- IoT creates ubiquitous computing environments with massive data implications
- Informed consent is crucial but often inadequately implemented
- Building smarter societies requires balancing innovation with human values and rights
