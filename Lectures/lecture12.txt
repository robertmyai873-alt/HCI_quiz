[Auto-generated transcript. Edits may have been applied for clarity.]
Actually, this is a lie. I am very happy that you are finishing it because I need to pay attention to other stuff.

Other, uh, student, other research and other stuff. But overall, I will say it's a good semester with a few exception, uh,

that we received about, uh, group formation and some complained about the groups.

So overall, I am very happy with this, uh, uh, batch of students because.

Keep it up for the next, uh, semester to. But for the next semester, be careful because it will be a bit harder.

Okay. And if you are, uh. If you are, let's name happy with your group.

You can keep that group for your next semester project. Which will be a robotics group, uh, group, and it will be much more hardware oriented.

So I think it will be better if you already know your group members and if you are happy to work with them.

So just keep that in mind. What we did.

We did a lot of stuff, actually. There's, uh, over ten weeks of the content.

And, uh, it was quite challenging, both for me and both for you and.

Today we will do some exam question. But before doing it, I need to give you information about the exam and the incoming incoming assignments.

First. The deadline for the remaining assignments are 5th December.

So if you are, if you can submit, uh, early, that will be good.

Then we will, uh, great. Early for you.

But overall, you should expect that your, uh, grades will be announced if you are submitting to receipts after, uh, December 5th.

And for the remaining groups, we will try to grade your, uh.

All deliverables be for the exam.

So you will learn your address for the exam. But if you have a summer contract, uh, contract, contradictory results.

And what you are expecting from us is not, uh, is not, uh, the thing that you, uh, uh, deserved.

Just let us know. Okay. Especially, uh, let me know in advance.

We will take care of it. And, uh, please don't worry if you.

Are sure that there is an error. There is some problem in your grading, okay.

No matter what happens, we can fix it. So it can be after the exam or, uh, even in the next semester.

We can't fix it. Just check 100% and be sure that there is some errors in the grading.

Then we will fix it. But do not send me an email just randomly.

Can we check this together or, uh, I have some suspicious that this grade should be higher.

So if you are not coming with an excuse or with an reasoning, I will, uh, suggest you directly go to the exam board.

Okay. Then from that path you can reach me and we will re-evaluate your, uh, projects.

And if you want to be re-evaluated, okay, you will be rehabilitated as a group.

So it means that maybe we missed something and we kind of.

Up, uh, the, uh, upgrade your, uh, uh, grades or you can be downgraded to.

Okay, so in this time, we will have a lot of time and we can go and check each line of your submission,

and you can be sure that downgrading will be possible.

So just be careful. And another thing that's that's might surprise you, but you already know this one.

The last one. So here, if you have some group members, that's who are not contributing to your assignment, their grade will be zero.

And now probably some of them, they are not aware.

That's okay. Their great will be zero. But we already mentioned a few times in the articles in the first lecture and uh, uh, in the MIT lecture two.

So it means that if in the contribution section of your assignments.

Your group members, uh, agree that your contribution is super minimal.

Okay, look, um, there are some cosmetic contributions. Then your grade assignments will be zero.

Okay. And we cannot do it now, but we will adjust it when we submit to, uh.

Uh, Osiris. So then your group rate will be, let's say 5 or 6, ten, whatever, but your individual grades will be zero.

Okay. So just be careful. That's okay.

What you expect may not be a match. What you get. And another thing is exam date is now well announced.

It is 8th of December. Everybody knows.

Okay, get the, uh uh uh, get the great.

Get the date. And please register to exam as early as possible.

Okay. And if somehow, Miss Dunn, we cannot, uh, allow you to take the exam.

And in that position, I cannot do anything, basically. Okay, so it will be, uh, a bit, uh.

Uh, what? Same, uh, ugly situation. Okay. Both for you and but for me.

But you cannot take the exam. Okay, so for the remaining, uh uh uh uh, stuff for your assignments, just check this video.

And this is one of the of this is one of the good videos actually we had last year not last year, last year.

And you are already familiar with it, and we are expecting something in line with this submission.

Okay. As you can see, it's currently loading.

We're just going. So if I were you, I will watch this, uh, video with my group members and just understand that what kind of interaction,

visual elements and the context is necessary for the high fidelity program that has some things that I would like to try out.

So we just see where it goes later on the description.

Okay. Yeah, that kind of stuff would be enough for you to get the hybrid.

I will not say that you will get the top grade, but you will get the high grade. And with one exception, one group has an, uh, hardware, uh, project.

Okay. And for the high fidelity prototype, I may invite you to my office.

Okay. I see some interesting faces. Okay. Office, then.

Uh, your group, uh, will, uh, show me the, uh, the demo, but, uh, please do not worry.

Okay. It will be super smooth and just, uh, I will.

Ask question to understand how much you did by yourself, or how much your group members contribute to this project.

Okay, and for that hardware project, it will be important if you keep that group the same.

If they are getting the high grade for the next semester project.

So then you can do more advanced, more interesting projects with the Raspberry Pi, Arduino or the Nvidia Jetson.

Okay, so now we can start for or exam question, but other than this, do you have any questions?

Because this is the last lecture. And, uh, this week we haven't lost, uh, that's session two.

So that will be your first opportunity to ask questions.

No question. I think it's clear. Because next week I will not be.

So I will be off and, uh, I will have a super limited time for the, uh, emails.

Just be careful if you cannot reach me on time. Okay.

So. Shall we start over?

The other question. Yes.

Can you increase your voice? Oh, yeah. Yeah.

The Figma, uh, prototype. It'll be okay. And, uh.

Of course, your face. Yeah. Then, uh, if you can do with the, uh.

With the same, uh, real, uh, fan interaction, right, with your phone and the shop and you doing that.

Is that people for this? Under.

You can do it with the Adobe Premiere or any kind of video editing tool.

Okay, so we are not grading your, uh, editor super, uh, skills.

We are just interested, okay.

Whether interaction content and visual elements are, uh, that in your, uh, uh, in your, uh, presentation and that would be.

Okay. Questions? Discuss. No.

Okay before starting the exam question. Let me do some other stuff.

So this course is important for me because in my PhD I took.

This course, actually. Creative engineering design, but that is definitely.

And it was super, super interesting for me and I always want to imitate him.

Not in my life, not in my, uh, lectures.

And now I will, uh, go and introduce to a few stuff that might you might use it especially for the hardware minded,

uh, people among us or engineers by people among us. And this is a famous professor and he is a famous roboticist.

And he's applying the. Not user centred design, but the design thinking principles in his research.

And you will see what kind of, uh, uh, what kind of interesting stuff that he is building.

And of course, like uh, or lecture. He's also giving some, uh, quotes from the famous, uh, scientists and engineers.

And this is a thing that he did in the Berkeley. And this is the robot that he built.

In his, uh, research and check it. This one. And these are the reliefs that you are receiving from your peers.

Okay. Like we are submitting a paper and another professor or another, uh, researchers are evaluating your, uh, your paper and what they said here.

This is very interesting. The second one, I like design of the robot.

This is exactly what I have been planning to build. But I have not achieved so far.

Okay. So what? Uh, professor, uh, Stephanie said to us, actually, he followed the design thinking principles similar to Euclid cycle,

and he built that this kind of, uh, I don't know, the not fish, but, uh, warm class, um, uh, snake like robot.

So what I want to show with this slide is basically the thing that we are teaching to you has also some footprint in the hardware and the research,

as well as in the digital uh interface design. And you see the same book again in here.

This is the creative confidence. And this is the Steve Jobs video.

Now I will, uh, let you know also that video. And a lot of stuff that we are teaching in here.

You will see the. It exists. And I will show probably.

Yeah. This is our. Uh, PhD classroom.

I guess this is not my batch, but I was part of this one. And instead of using the digital tools, we are using the post-its, actually.

And one of the groups from this class. Actually, they opened their Start-Up company for soft robots.

So it was quite interesting to be part of this class and you will see a lot of different.

The kind of applications. Oh. What's this? Yeah.

This one, this one. A lot of stuff. So my messages to you, you know, already know the basic design principles.

So it's up to you to implement in your life.

And if you do it differently, you will get some extra bonus points for your, uh, not maybe assignment, but for your, uh, for your future.

And this is the thing that he showed us for the first and the last video, and I am doing the same thing.

Let's see. Okay.

I don't know what you think about Steve Jobs. What's the perfect example for this? Uh, kind of slights.

The thing I would say is. When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your.

Your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much.

Uh, try to have a nice family life. Uh. Have fun.

Save a little money. Um. But life.

That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is,

everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.

And you can change it. You can influence it. You can. You can build your own things that other people can use.

And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will,

you know, if you push it, something will pop out the other side. You can you can change it.

You can mould it.

Um, that's maybe the most important thing is to shake off this, uh, this, uh, erroneous notion that life is is there and you're just going to live in.

Versus embrace it. Change it. Improve it. Make your mark upon it.

Um, I think that's very important.

And however you learn that once you learn it, uh,

you will want to change your life and make it better, because it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways.

Um, once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.

Okay, this is, uh, a bit motivational speech, but trust me, it has some value on it.

Just go and watch it. And of course, you can say that we are now getting with exams, grades, whatever,

how we can contribute to, uh, this kind of, uh, robotics, this kind of design in our life.

But later in your life, definitely, you will have some opportunity to, uh, to do it.

Okay, now for the exam questions. First we need to read this one.

Okay. So exam will be in Oncampus.

And you will use a test visual interface to answer around 50.

Question. Okay. And each question has a two points.

And you have to get. Uh, 5.5 or 55.

To pass the course. Okay. If you get, let's say 15 here, then you are failing.

Okay. And if you feel you will take the, uh, course scratch from next year.

Like you cannot say that. Okay, I already passed with the, uh, practice session.

I only failed the, uh, the example. So can I, uh, be exempted from the, uh, practical, uh, uh, projects next year?

You cannot do this. Okay. So you need to get to 5.5 or 55 for this exam.

Under. It is quite easy to get it look at so you don't need to worry.

That's my experience between the autonomous systems and the HCI.

HCI is much more easy to parse. And of course, that the fact that how prepared are you and it is a bit correlated, uh, to your, uh, group project.

Okay. Because students have a some misunderstanding, actually.

Okay. Because they are not attending the practice session and the classes.

And all they think about their project throughout the semester.

At the end, they are thinking that these are two different things.

But in reality, if you pay attention to your group project, then definitely your, uh, grade will be quite similar to your, uh, final exam.

Okay. So I can say that that correlation exists.

And exam time is quite enough for you. Uh, you have three minutes to answer one question, so it is quite, quite easy.

And we have a different types of, uh. Exam.

Uh, questions can be open ended. That you will write a few, uh, one paragraph at most to answer the question.

And in the open ended questions, please just give. A few sentences to ask for the question.

Okay. If you are writing a full paragraph that's super verbose and expecting that okay,

if I confuse, uh, confused, uh, teacher, then uh, maybe I can hook some grades later.

Don't do this. Okay, we got a word that. And your, uh, answer should be concrete.

And please use HCI concept as much as possible. Like, do not say, okay, this is an object.

I am performing an action on that object. This object is useful for this kind of user group.

Don't use this kind of stuff okay. So that the performance of this object is pushing.

And that's why when I see the button I am clicking okay.

And yes, please do not assume that being verbose will lead to full grant.

That's that's a lot of, uh, things to get from.

But I will show a you, uh, uh, samples that you will understand.

And some open ended questions will ask you that. Give two examples.

Okay. Like, uh, what are the different types of stakeholders?

Okay. Then you will say that. Tertiary stakeholders and secondary stakeholders.

You can give this one. What if you are giving six more?

Now. We will not read it. Okay? We will only check the first.

Even the third one will be correct, but the first one will be incorrect.

Then you will not get the full grade. Okay. Is this clear?

Is. Make sure that. If question asks you to give two examples, give only two.

If you give three, then third one would not be included in your list.

Okay. And in a fill in the blank questions, you may write a few, uh uh uh, yeah, a few, uh, words.

Not assume that each blank. It corresponds only one word.

No, it may be like, let's say in the high case, we will assume that you are writing human robot interaction.

So in reality, this is three different words. But in our case, it would be a single blank.

Okay. And what else?

Wait for the fill in the blank. If you are using, uh, as synonyms, we may accept.

Okay. And this is, uh. May. Okay. Might. So if you are, uh, writing, uh, action instead of affordance, we will not accept.

Okay. If you are writing for us.

Principles and heuristics. Yeah, that can be acceptable.

Okay. And yet we will try to announce our grades as early as possible within one week or two.

Three days. Then you can book. Uh, we will announce the.

Uh, not receipt, but, uh, inspection the dates that you will come to my office and check the,

uh, your exam paper if you are not happy with your grade. And one.

Uh. One advice that I can give it to you.

Please stay within the HCI terminology.

Okay. Like you may bring your own background to to answer the question.

I don't know whether you are from philosophy or from other disciplines.

But here we are teaching HCI. So your answer has to be within this HCI terminology.

Okay. Do you have any questions related to this cover page?

No. Okay.

Them. Let's go to the first question. And I will not share the video of, uh, session of this uh, uh, lecture because here I will, uh.

Uh, you will see the, uh, question and we will make a brainstorming about the answer.

So that will convince confused the students who are watching this video.

So it's better to, uh. It's better for me to not to share the images.

Okay, so this is the first question. It is super simple.

Okay. What's the. Concepts in here.

You don't need to take the photo. I will share with the commons.

Okay. You asking? Stupid. Okay.

Okay. What is the, uh. What is written? What should be written in the box?

You are already doing for your assignment. This little time.

Okay, but that is the half of the question. With other half.

And what's the other half of the question? Okay.

What is the name of processes illustrated in box A and? You one method that can be applied in the lead finding step.

Okay. And half of the students will fail with this question, or it will get only partial answer or partial grade for this question.

Yeah. Brainstorming. That can be anyone. Yeah. So don't forget this question has two parts.

Okay? One part is in here. Most of the time, a sense of giving the exam in here like a low fidelity prototype.

But actually a question asks give the one steps in here.

Okay. I like interviews for the news.

Finding like surveys with finding.

So your answer was incorrect in this case. Okay.

So I thought about the sponsor. You see, we shouldn't share the video.

Okay, cool. So, is it easy?

The super hot. Come on.

It is a shame for me to ask this kind of question. Because you already dealing with at this time weeks for this.

Uh. Uh, circle again. Again. But be careful and read the question very well.

You have three minutes to read and answer this question so you don't need to rush hour.

Okay, so what is the common mistake students are doing?

They know this is prototyping and they are giving example in here. Method in here.

Okay. So just read it carefully and to understand it.

Okay. So for the. This is since, uh, open ended one like an you have to write it.

Just write this one. It will be enough. Okay. Back. Say prototyping and the methods for it finding.

I am asking one. Okay. If you are giving a five, then we will go and check and accept as an answer for the first one.

Okay. Let's say this is wrong. Okay, you said storyboarding in here, then interviewing, then you will not get the grade for that part of the question.

Okay. Another question.

Okay. Who wants to? Go.

Okay. And. So one case is another case.

Okay. Like an on and off stuff. Okay. Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

Two. To. To lighten the lightness, but the.

Expanded. I understand. This is.

It's an on and off. I don't know. But you have to mention bit careful your clients.

Okay. What else can be? It's success.

Okay. Like a status message. You okay? Yeah. Okay.

Yeah. Feedback can be okay.

More. Okay. All of them are accepted except turning on and turning off has to be a bit detailed.

Cool. So we have an almost all of them.

I can start a software system error message and different type of information like a attachment for instance.

Okay. And if you write only one of them, you will get one point.

Okay. So if you will. Right.

There's six of them and the first two are correct.

You will get two points, not, uh, six. Okay.

Uh, what's the difficulty level of this question?

Zero. Because we are always mentioning and you can retrieve from your project.

So if you are using correctly, uh, coloured correctly in your, uh, Google project, definitely you can ask for the square question.

Just here. The example is in the electronics domain, but there is no difference in the electronics and the user interface design for us.

Okay. All right, let's go with this one.

Yes. Also true. False.

Which one? But. First one is false and second one is true.

Okay. And in the examples right. It's a false be true.

Okay. If right or say false and true I will assume that false is for a and the true is for B.

Okay. And if you are, uh please do not write uh tolls okay.

True. False. Whatever. So be certain and a false be true a to be false okay.

So be certain. And if you are trying to make some tricks okay.

A to slash F. So don't do this.

And you are laughing. But people of essence are doing okay.

Maybe they are indicating they will come back to that question, but they are not answering on time, so stays in there.

Okay, so you said a false and be true.

Any other suggestion? Oh, I mean, that's super easy question.

And your answer is correct. Okay. And if you know the keyword intelligent in here, basically you can answer this question.

Okay. And what is the difficulty level of this question?

Zero. Okay, how about this one?

This is a bit tricky. Okay.

Who wants to try? Sorry.

First one. Second one. Okay.

You don't know this. Fine. Any other, uh, solution?

Yes. Second one's vision.

Okay. And the first one. If you know what you.

Oh. I think that. Okay.

But if you know, the second one is today, I know that personally I will show the absolute value of God.

Perception. Not quite, but you are very close.

Uh. You want? Sons and sons can be different.

And what kind of sons it differs from usually.

In five senses. Okay. What is the term for that?

Five senses. I mean, face that.

Okay. These are different. Sensation. What are they? They common name.

Census. Yeah.

Senses. Perceptions are. Associated sensors.

Okay. So yeah, cognition calls the, uh, it's reception sense.

Also perception also. But the correct keyword is extra assumptions.

And if you go to the first lecture first, uh, one of the first slides, you will see that we are mentioning in here in the cognition.

Also we divide uh, sensing in interception reception.

And there was another one proprioception okay.

Here. It might be hard to answer this one.

Okay. You are asking us? No, I will come to that point.

Okay. So here, uh, it may be hard to ask for this one,

but if you say something that I can refer to it as similar to extra reception, then I will, uh, accept it.

Okay. But perception is incorrect. Cognition is incorrect.

Sensor is incorrect. English. Okay.

So do you remember interception. And give the one example just on the concept, but you inside the existing.

How about the proprioception? Proprioception?

Proprioception. Okay. Like, close your eyes on the planet.

So this is properties. Okay.

Yeah. What is the difficulty level of this one? Over, uh, from 0 to 5, let's say three.

Okay. This one.

You have no right to ask for this question.

Incorrectness. Because everything is in the figurative. Oh, come.

Okay. Who wants to try? If I were you.

I will try to answer all questions, because the thing that you experience in here will be much more memorable for your,

uh, more, uh, long term memory in the example. All right.

What is the goal for execution? Come on.

Come on, don't be shy. Yes, you.

This process behind the different execution produced area where feedback from user input.

I don't understand. Whenever you're working on Google, uh, feedback goes.

The world to the glory of what you are expecting. The secret to not extend.

Okay, just tell me what is execution? This is just for helpful to remind.

Okay. Cool. Uh. You want?

First of all. An exceptional family.

Okay. Uh. Another one. Vice.

Looks like. Yes.

Right. Yes.

You are rounding the ground. More conflicts also.

Oh, okay. Uh, we should minimise it.

To maximise it. Get rid of it. What does that mean?

That you want to focus? We are referring to here in the execution.

Okay. Come on. This is super, super simple.

And. All golf has to be.

Okay. That's what is minimised. Reduce indigo.

Minimise indigo. Why? Because my goal is here and I want to bring the world as close as possible to the goal.

Okay. And to do this, I have to function. One is goal of execution.

Like I see a product and I performing a one action to discover how it works.

Okay. And that becomes good for execution if it is intuitive and the affordances are clear,

if I are there, then I will be super easily to perform this task.

Okay, so this is called goal for execution. Sorry, I can't go.

So if I describe the execution not in this definition, but as an example, for example.

Minimise the steps which you have to take not to achieve that particular action.

Not here. No, because the question asks you define.

It doesn't ask you to, uh, give an example.

Okay. You can first define and give an example, but I will not try to example.

Okay. So example. Sorry. Uh, yeah. If question ask you to give an example, give an example.

Okay. Otherwise stick with the definition. Okay.

And in here. Do not forget you always need to minimised.

Well. Okay. I mean this.

Oh well. Let's see. What is the difficulty level of this question?

Three. One. Three.

Okay. Five. Come on.

I will have a heart attack. Okay? I can. No, this is not in the, uh.

Um, uh. Hard question. Okay, how about this? Yes.

Because you are unable. They didn't want to.

Okay. Okay.

And, uh. And what else? It was because.

Bridges the east coast. I've always known.

Okay. You show more information. Okay. Okay.

Perfect. You. How?

Combination of both. It will not work in here, obviously. Audio message which completed.

But this one is saying that, okay, the voting process is already finished.

Then it's shoving the audio message on the victory sign. So it means that the system is not invisible in here.

You don't know at which part of the building steps are you? Yeah.

So here it is. Big. But since, uh, the question ask you to explain.

Okay, so you have to first be correct one.

Then, uh, choose the correct one. Then explain this.

Okay. So your explanation might be correct, but the choice is incorrect.

Um, as for it's uh uh will not be graded.

Okay. And for the heuristics, just learn the one that you will implement in your high fidelity prototype.

Okay. We will not ask what is the, uh, six uh, principles from, uh, Neil?

Uh, sorry. Uh, normal. Okay.

And you will be only responsible, the one that you are doing for your, uh, project.

Cool. Otherwise you will have a bunch of. I mean, if you are expensive for clearly you know for certain rench, I may accept it.

Okay, but see, you should agree with me, okay?

Uh, you should agree with me and, uh, ask for within that framework, because booting is, uh.

Okay. You know, uh, you are not taking any systems level, uh, class in, like, an operating system, some other stuff.

So voting is not just an instant process, okay? Your computer will go and check the, uh, file from there.

It will check the, uh, drivers are okay.

Then the graphical user interface are okay for you.

Okay, so it's a process, and we need to be sure that that is, uh.

Oh, that's a mistake. Okay, then. What is the difficulty level of, uh, difficulty of this, uh, question?

Two. Okay one.

Okay, now I agree with you. Zero. Okay, cool.

All right. How about this one? And this is not my question.

The question three years ago by one one of the. Okay.

What's the answer? You want. Okay.

Any other answer? Difficulty is zero.

I see you have had some putts, right? For once related to it.

It may trade, but not more.

Difficulty zero. Just right. It started as.

Simulation. Stimulation.

Okay, so the simulation of what? But then he said something similar.

I hardly think so. Cloth.

You. The correct answer is senior fashion.

Okay. And what is the difference between affordance and the signifier? Versus a simulation will not be accepted.

Okay. It is not even close to that a word.

Stimulation simulation, whatever stuff it's.

Okay. What's the difference between affordance and signifier? Of importance as a direct associate.

Or direct actions. Okay. Signifier is just abstract.

It doesn't affect anything else. Okay. Okay.

You. No, you.

So this was. It's clarifies what can what action can be done.

Okay. Remember there is a door and handle is giving me pull or push as an action.

And this action is an affordance when it's not clear how to open this door.

And you are saying that pull, then that pull as a text is a signifier.

Okay. And the signifier can be audio, can be colour, can be anything that helps you to perform that action.

Okay. So there are two different things. Usually since are confusing about it.

Now we can give an, uh, 15 minute break then come back.

And we still have ton of questions. And the difficulty of this question is zero.

Okay. Still within its reach to five. It's good.

Sources. Uh, who are here? If you didn't complete the course evolution, that is for canvas.

There is an announcement for it. And do it, uh.

Right now. Okay, let's start for the second session.

Okay. This is the one of the narrative, uh, questions sexual.

Ouch. So first thing.

You will be always responsible for Nielsen's heuristics. Okay.

So it. Just, uh, do not confuse with the, uh, Norman and the other, uh, heuristic, uh, uh, of tricks.

You will always ask for Nielsen's heuristics for the final exam.

Okay. So which one can you?

Yes. You want to try? Okay.

Another one. It's.

International support for. Okay.

You. Design for error.

Okay. Mob. Sorry, people.

Okay. Okay. More. You are close, but it's not touristic.

Okay. Another one. We have almost five different principles, but some of overlapping.

Okay. Why? This is not for, uh, the Coalition of Recall. So because it is warning to you.

This doesn't exist. We'll get to you.

Would you like to listen to this woman? Let's close. And in the heuristics.

If you you don't need to, uh, give the exact name of the hitter stick.

Okay. Is something related to error? Error?

Error prevention? Okay. Not allowing to make an error.

This will be accepted versus. Okay.

I will say this. Yes. Can I just. Okay.

And, uh, what is the, uh. Difficulty levels.

Three. Two. I would say this is, let's say three so that we didn't exceed it over three.

I just want to. Maybe. Okay, so the question asked, uh, you write the two advantages of within subject design over between subject design.

And, uh, here you should not define what is really what is between subjects.

And we are not asking you to define it. You will just write to different advantages of the.

Yes. You need to understand. Okay.

For within subject design, you need a substance? Yes.

Okay. Then the second one. You can see the same parts.

We all. Okay.

And that is the definition. That's the definition.

Yum. I couldn't it exactly the advantages of that.

Okay. Yeah. There will be some advantages. Maybe some cost.

Because you are hiring one person for the one experiment for one person, a person for the two experiment.

What else can be? Let's say one. Okay.

Two. What is the advantage of having, uh.

Uh, conducting, uh, willingness to subject to design experiments.

This is not hard question. Well, you can compared the principle on how one person interacts with different things.

Okay. And though that is still in the definition of the evidence.

But you should uh, I know, you know, uh, that's an advantage.

But you should make it more clear. Like you can discover actually true correlation.

In the, uh, within subject. Just check it.

Uh, this. And I don't have an answer for it because each answer would be different.

But if you write that, uh, time will be one advantage of it, budget can be another advantage of it.

Third, you can discover the, uh, true correlation in the conditions, like single person tries different settings.

Instead of one person, place each one person.

Try one setting another person so you can discover the true correlation of the what you are measuring.

Okay, how about this one? Just to give you a bias, the difficulty is zero.

Maybe less than zero points. Oh.

Find examples. Forget the spark of. Just answer this.

So hospital, uh, how do you, as a designer, interaction designer or industrial designer for the,

uh, designing, and you draw and you come up with this kind of design?

Okay. One part is can be pulled and other parts.

There is no handle. The only action that you can do is push.

So now the management team says that's what kind of.

Uh, concepts that you applied that makes the store opened or closed intuitively.

So what is that concept and define? Oh, yes.

What's the concept? Okay.

Your. Users. Oh, no.

There's just something more. Come on.

This is the easiest one. Okay.

The answer is. If you see a new object, okay, this is a new door and you can intuitively use it.

It means that the designers put affordances in a clear way that you can perform the action.

Okay, so the concept is affordance and the definition.

The condition of the, uh, concept is. What is the definition of the concept of what's?

Action opportunities provided by an object.

Okay. This is the definition of. Okay, then.

Uh, this one. Yeah, yeah. Difficulty is zero.

Okay. If you don't know anything from the HCI after two, three years, just know what is inference.

Okay. Then it will. It will. Uh, this is my legacy.

Please do not forget what is affordances. Okay, the new question.

Who wants to say? Was maybe more, uh, diverse.

Go. Primary attention.

Okay. Anyone else wants to try.

Okay. Let's see. First, what is the difficulty of this question?

Zero mean. Absolutely not. Can. Amethyst.

Okay. Please do not write.

This is user stakeholder. Okay, because it is a bit.

Let's name the tautology in here. And the tertiary.

If you can write, for instance, first level stakeholder and the third level stakeholder, we might consider if this is correct okay.

But just now this two second the primary secondary and tertiary will be enough.

And of course, facilitating was the. Okay, this is the famous question.

Okay. Which one is it? Product. Which one?

First of all. Why? That's why the first one is HIV and not the second.

Okay. So to answer this question, please always remember this one.

Okay. Like at the input. Uh, so the output of your user becomes input of your.

Computer. And this is computing something. This is an electronic wallet for your cryptocurrencies.

And this is my, uh, regular wallet. Okay. I'm not using both of them, but.

Right. But here. Please do not be super, super creative, okay?

Do not say that. This wallet's maybe doing some computation under atomic levels, whatever quantum stuff is going on.

That's why it can be considered as a computer. No.

Okay. We are not accepting this one. So basically just say that output of the user will become input of this device.

And this device will do some processing and give.

Output to the its user. And if you make it, uh, in this case that content from the user to the computer.

We already asked for this one. Then they are, uh, acting as an entity to solve the task.

Then if you answer within this circle and the interaction, then we will accept your result.

Okay. Yeah. In here. That will be a exam question, but it is super simple.

Everybody knows what is the box say. Do I need to answer?

No. Okay.

Perfect. And anything else can get it.

Perfect. Usually a robot will not be accepted.

But in my case, if you write the robot instead of computer, I will accept it.

Okay. 14.

Okay. Who wants to try? Go through security.

These are the Gestalt principles. You can say that these are part of visual, uh, elements.

We might accept it. But be super articulate.

Okay. Yes. Purpose.

The second one. This. Colour palette. Okay.

Let me step out of the to give. I think if you're just like, uh uh uh uh uh.

Is that, is that like the first is the colour as a design element, you can say.

The second is the grid. Purpose of the grid is organise the information together.

And the purpose of the colour to give a functionality. To the text in here, fonts like the red one will be missing.

Uh, topic. Uh, blue one will be titled and the grey uh one will be what will be a date.

What else we have. Okay in this question, please do not list the colour.

Okay. Colour is the only one. It's a colour, red colour, blue colour, whatever colour would not be except just colour.

Okay. And the purpose of the colour is give the function for the text forces in here.

Another one is the grid. Another one is the font and typeface.

Another one is the hierarchy. Okay, so you should, uh, give this to one of this to them.

Define it. And, uh, two.

Yeah, yeah. Uh. Define it. Explain their functions and they name the, uh, the design element in here.

Okay. So what's the difficulty?

So the. A search bar in the.

Search bar. What does the search bar go? Sense.

Super. Is that a topical division? You don't.

You cannot say the search bar is a part of a Disneyland. It's a part of visual design element.

But not the designer. What's the name? What's the name of the.

So it's like an application and navigation button and it.

So if you say the number is it's accepted. But nobody's in the one part of the visual design element.

What is the purpose of it? Navigate through the pages.

I mean, this is very, very fishy, I swear, I will say. But do not try.

If I ask you, just ask for certain stuff, okay? Let's check it.

Uh, what? Is the Duchess here?

Okay. And if you.

Come here. Let's see. Here.

Okay. So in this visual, uh, design, you cannot find the navigation path.

Yeah, it's part of the website and other stuff you can set.

Uh, like the one that you set. Uh, I guess that, uh, stuff.

Okay, so we cannot, uh, we cannot accept the text.

Okay. Uh, okay.

So difficulty is still three. I will see. Huh?

This one. If you make this one wrong, then I will lose at least three years in my life, okay?

Just. And be careful looking. So because I am very, very upset that students are making a mistake in here.

Okay. Who wants to kill me? Yeah.

What is the, uh, answer of this question? So breathe means that's okay.

Minimise it. You want to. Don't try. Let's give us some high risk high.

Hi game. Okay. Uh, who is responsible to minimise the ghosts?

Come on. Come on.

Right. Okay, so be careful.

That's. Okay. You're a size designer.

What else can be? User.

Both team. Students.

Yeah. Who can be responsible? For bridging this, uh, gap.

Or minimising this gap. Reducing this gap. Come on.

Okay. So I should accept that. It is designers responsible with this design team responsible for social responsibility.

If you write user no. Cool.

Okay, so as far as the designer.

And you see, almost all questions are related to, uh, except maybe extra receptive, uh, uh, questions and some question related to your group project.

If, you know, and if you do group projects, well, definitely you can ask for this kind of simple questions.

Okay. This one, this is a bit debateable. We need to, uh, discuss actually.

Just, uh, let's discuss this question. We already did it once, but let's go.

I'm not a Christian. This one? Yeah. Like, how can this be achieved?

Know who is responsible. Yeah.

Then the second part. Okay. Forget. How can this assume.

Okay, then let me this because you've. He's responsible.

Okay. Thank you for doing. Thank you.

Okay. What is the ideal state of this graph? Okay.

Here we have on the usability problems.

Maybe you are designing for a colour-blind person, but some of the colour palette is not for colour-blind person.

That is the visibility problem. And. You are saying that.

Okay. The you have in the 1980s.

Um, the 16 usability problems. And at the end of your experiments and the data.

You have this graph. Each black dot in here means that your user find the usability problem.

Okay. Back here. User zero.

Find this usability problem but fail to find this usability problem.

Okay. Now my question is what is the ideal state?

Of this beautiful ideal state can mean that this will be completely black, completely white, or it is already.

In its ideal state. We don't need to do anything. So what will be your aspiration?

You go. Everything. Let everything black. Why?

Then all problems have been solved by all the different evaluators. Okay, let's go downstairs and accept it.

There is. If you like to go? Yes. Then your design team achieve everything.

So that's also ideal state. And what else can be.

There is also one thing that I can accept.

For the usability problem in here in that stuff. And you will say that these are the less frequently find the usability problem.

Maybe it's not important for your product design okay. So this has been the not single ask for all transfer and all lands for us to be articulated.

If you do in that way that we discussed and it will be. Okay.

The difficulty is still three. This is the.

Last one. I will see you. Go to the barber shop.

Okay. So you are a go.

Okay. What else can we. Low.

Medium. Wizard of Oz. Okay.

Which one? Come on. You are already doing this.

Yes. Okay. So the question does not ask you to explain.

Okay. Just give the answer. The answer is the median filter to protect.

Okay, now we finish our, uh. Go. Only on the one.

But you have to articulate Tokyo looking like a full black.

All these little problems. Font full white. There is no of the problem in the, um, uh, product.

And the third, you don't need to. 12.

And the computer process it and the. Output of the computer will be input of your, uh, your user.

Okay. Yes. Your question. Are you sure?

How idealistic. Okay.

More question. No. Okay.

For the 17, uh, question we solved in here. You see, almost everything is related to your group project.

So it means that the if you know the concepts that you are using for your group project, definitely you can pass the final exam.

Okay. And for the final exam, you are responsible for slides, compulsory reading your practice session.

So you are responsible for everything existing except for the optional readings.

Okay. Yeah. This.

This is the thing for the heuristics. Do not forget, you are only responsible for Nielsen.

Okay, so you will, uh, apply five Nielsen for your high fidelity prototype.

But you are responsible for the exam. All of the need, some heuristics.

Okay. And what else do you have?

Yes. I have a difficulty.

Just. I come up in this, uh, class. Okay, so this is the general one.

If you achieve, let's say we solve 17 and check the slides, you will definitely discover six more questions.

Then it will be 25. And within that 25 I am sure if you do delivery you will do 24.

Right. So it is not. That's hard practice.

And of course it depends your mood, your reading.

Uh. Reading ability or whatever the, uh, psychology that you are into in the exam.

So you shouldn't expect much harder than this kind of questions.

That doesn't mean that you shouldn't know the concepts and the principles.

So if you are comfortable with it, definitely. But this is the final lecture.

Please come to the practice sessions if you have questions,

because that will be last chance for you to get the direct contact with us, especially with me.

Um, other than this, evaluations are open. Please.

If you want to take your events from this, go. And, uh, across the US.

So see you maybe next to next semester.

One question about this project.

Uh.
